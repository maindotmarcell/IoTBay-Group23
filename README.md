# IoTBay
## Installing Dependencies
You need to install the following packages to get the proper styling (you need to have **Python** and **pip** installed first):
- Bootstrap
```
pip install django-bootstrap-v5
```
- Django crispy forms
```
pip install django-crispy-forms
```

- Pillow
```
pip install pillow
```

## How to run
Enter into the IoTBay_Group23 directory (the innermost one):
```
cd IoTBay_Group23
```
Then type the following command into your terminal:
```
python manage.py runserver
```
You can then click on the IP and port combination it gives you and you'll see the application working in your browser.
